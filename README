We tested all sorts of files/directories. For the first part, we tested files that were empty, files
that only had white spaces such as tabs, spaces, or new lines. We tested scenarios where only the 
width was given, and in these such cases we outputted EXIT_FAILURE due to no file or directory. We 
also tested cases where the words was equal to the length, or if a word was longer than the length. 
Additionally, we tested for files that had multiple white space lines or files that started with the
word in the middle of the page. For the second part, we tested directories with no entries, tested 
directories, that had multiple files, and tested directories with a combination of subdirectories 
and files, to make sure that our code skipped over the subdirectories. After testing all of these 
different scenarios, we are confident in our program.
